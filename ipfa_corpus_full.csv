4823719,2021-10-19,"Credit reporting, credit repair services, or other personal consumer reports",Credit reporting,Incorrect information on your report,Information belongs to someone else,"Consumer Financial Protection Bureau : I wish to dispute any and all association with Discover Card credit account tied to my credit score. At no time have I ever had an account with Discover Card, nor have I ever authorized anyone to open such an account. I humbly request that all references to this account, and the negative marks related to its delinquent status, be dissociated from any record of my credit history.

I began checking my credit regularly several years ago after the report of a substantial data breach within the South Carolina Revenue Service. Using the XXXX XXXX app I noticed an account with Discover Card was under my name. After beginning my investigation in earnest, my then wife and now ex-wife informed me she opened this unauthorized account. At no point did I ever receive a Discover  Card, a statement was never forwarded to me, nor did I ever make a single purchase using that account. 

I have contacted Discover Card dozens of times informing them that this account was created without my consent. Protests have been filed and appeals have been submitted. The only Discover Card associated with this account that I have ever seen is in the name of my ex-wife. I have never be in possession of a Discover Card with my name on it, nor have I ever made a single purchase of any kind with such a card. Furthermore, I have produced the divorce documents stating that my ex-wife, ( name redacted per your request ) takes full responsibility for addressing the balance of the Discover Card. This is account is NOT responsibility. 

I authorize your organization to do a full review of my credit history and consult with any and all of my other creditors. You will find no other late or delinquent accounts, nor any accounts that were ever late or delinquent. Actually, you will find that I have paid off every vehicle and or loan early. My mortgage has every so much as had a late payment of any kind. 

Please, I beg your agency to use a modicum of discernment regarding this circumstance. All logic points to the fact that this delinquent account is not mine. Discover is engaged in character assassination of the most odious kind. I have thousands of dollars of debt in my name, all being serviced and reduced in accordance with the original terms agreed to with my creditors at the time each account was established. 

A credit score is supposed to an attempt to accurately display a persons credit worthiness. Due to Discovers refusal to clear my name, even though they MUST know this is not my debt, it continues to negatively affect my good name. I ask that your agency correct this travesty by removing this erroneous information for the reporting of my credit history. 

I you will just give me the opportunity, I am will to speak to anyone, travel anywhere, supply documents, provide affidavits, etc. to clear my name and correct this injustice. 

Thank you for your consideration.",,DISCOVER BANK,SC,29229,,Consent provided,Web,2021-10-19,Closed with explanation,Yes,

Our XXXX  private banker in XXXX added a Checking Plus account to our joint checking account. My ex husband closed aforementioned account last summer/fall XXXX. According to XXXX, XXXX made no mention of the XXXX checking plus account while visiting a branch to close the account. XXXX said he would've paid it off and closed the account immediately. Unfortunately, since the checking account was closed payments to the checking plus account were no longer auto debited. I immediately contacted XXXX as well as all three CRA 's to inform them the debt is not mine and collection efforts need to be directed to ex husband XXXX. I have called CRAs, disputed, explained, provided faxed documentation of my divorce decree to no resolve. XXXX has allowed this matter to worsen for 10 months of derogatory/ late payments, which has severely damaged my credit scores. Prior to the late payments, my range was in the XXXX and plummeted all the way down to lower XXXX. I have faxed XXXX our divorce decree ( dates below ) which states my ex husband is responsible in addition, he was ordered to REMOVE me from all joint accounts including our Mortgage and HELOC and is the responsible party. I faxed XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX requesting removal with my divorce decree, however I only received one letter in XXXX indicating the debt is valid. In addition to faxing, I have called and spoken with numerous departments and have hours of phone calls documented, including a conversation with a representative named XXXX from the XXXX whom submitted the request to remove me from the account while I waited on hold. Prior to this in XXXX, XXXX wrote a check payment for me go into a branch and pay. When I attempted to pay the account off, the branch manager of the XXXX XXXX branch said there is no such account on file. In XX/XX/XXXX the account went to collections. I immediately contacted rep XXXX XXXX with XXXX, whom refused to speak with me because I was not listed as an account holder! 

I have disputed with all three CRA 's numerous times and called them directly explaining the situation, including uploading the divorce decree, however the only one whose updated/ deleted the account is XXXX thus far. I have spent hours on the phone with Trans Union, XXXX and various XXXX departments in hope this could be resolved. 

This account has created significant issues such as : 1. ) I was not given preferred financing for my daughter 's lease in XX/XX/XXXX. I was in tier 3 and it cost me around $ XXXX more per month interest rate. 

2 ) One of my credit lines was closed completely in XXXX due to low FICO 3 ) Although this is not part of my complaint, I would like to add, XXXX has penalized me for my ex husband 's mortgage default in XXXX, XXXX and short sale in XXXX, even though my ex husband was ordered to remove me and quitclaim deed the property title over to XXXX as his sole property. XXXX reduced my two personal credit lines from XXXX down to XXXX in XXXX, and have not raised my credit limits despite a 100 % excellent payment history. 

XXXX ) I feel victimized and ignored by XXXX, XXXX and Transunion and calculated hours of phone calls from XXXX through XXXX. My understanding is XXXX needed to investigate within 30 days, however I have never received any responses to my disputes, except for 1 letter in XXXX stating the checking plus debt is valid. Furthermore, I would like it noted that I NEVER signed any paperwork to open the credit line in XXXX. I was a XXXX and XXXX XXXX XXXX mother until our divorce in XXXX!

In XX/XX/XXXX, I applied for a loan modification at the encouragement of Ocwen to assist with lowering my mortgage payment.  I was told I would have to do a trial period from XX/XX/XXXX to XX/XX/XXXX, which I completed successfully.  After this, I was told I would received permanent loan modification.  It took 3 months for Ocwen to send me the new terms and conditions of the loan, which had to be notarized.  I completed the paperwork and sent it back.  2 months later (in XX/XX/XXXX), I received a phone call indicating that the paperwork was rejected due to the co-borrower not signing (my ex husband).  I was very upset by this because my ex husband and I have been divorced XX/XX/XXXX.  He signed a quit claim deed back over to me and I sent that, along with my divorce decree to Ocwen the year we divorced.  I think the mortgage company was GMAC at the time.  Regardless, I resent the quit claim deed and Ocwen was able to find my divorce decree.  At this time, I contacted the Ombudsman through Ocwen.  They offered to have a notary come to me to resign the paperwork.   The notary came to my work and I completed the paperwork and then received a call a few days later that it had been rejected due to not signing correctly.  I was told that I needed to sign the paperwork with my married name, and then aka with my current last name, as it appeared on my quit claim deed.  The notary who came out initially was given the wrong direction and while meeting with me, called for clarification.  When this was rejected, I received another call from Ocwen and they sent another notary out to my home. This was on XX/XX/XXXX.  While there, she wanted me to sign the paperwork with my legal name and no aka.  I told her no, that was wrong, but she didn't have any further instruction.  After she left my house, I received a phone call from the title company who sent her and I let them know what happened and they called the notary back to my house and I signed the paperwork the way I was supposed to.  3 weeks later, I receive a phone call from Ocwen, and they tell me that the paperwork was rejected, as of XX/XX/XXXX, and I need to have the co-borrower sign!  They are referring to my ex husband and here we are back to square one.  I am going in circles with them.  I almost had XXXX on the phone with them and immediately called the Ombudsman again.  I am waiting for a call back now.  I am so frustrated because this has affected my credit score, as Ocwen is reported my account to be delinquent, as this has not been updated to the credit bureaus.   I have a 592 credit score because of them and there is absolutely nothing I can do, which is why I am reaching out to you.  If there is anything you can do to expedite this and to right the wrong they have done with my credit score, I would appreciate it.  I am a hard working person, I don't qualify nor want any state aid.  I have a good job.  I just fell behind due to my divorce.  This modification is taking 9 months now.  This is so unfair.

I told Navient at great length what I was going thru. All Navient ever offered was of course forbearance. This was perfect for them to add thousands of dollars of additional interest onto our student loan. I was NEVER told that I had options.

XXXX  advised they had everything and it looked good.     I never received any news from Navient ever during this process. No notice that they would be adding several additional thousands of dollars in interest.  XXXX  told me that during the three year waiting period that no interest could be added.

I contacted th e Office of the Advocate at   Navient and again asked what was wrong with my discharge.     I found out that only a portion of the loan was discharged due to the consolidation of our debt. My now ex-wife is now responsible along with me also. I was not truly discharged from anything at all. Thousands of dollars of interest have accumulated on the loan and its the same balance as before I requested the discharge. I have never received an approval for the discharge. I was never advised that only a portion of the loan would be discharged. I was never informed that I was still responsible for the entire loan. I am  XXXX  an d cant drive  or work!

We still owe over {$18000.00} on this student loan. Why are not my loan and the interest that goes with it discharged? If my loan was an individual loan it would have been. There have been thousands of dollars in payments made. I asked  the Office of  the Advocate for a printout from  XXXX  so I can see where the payments were applied and how they arrived at the discharge amount. THIS IS TOTALLY UNFAIR!

Navient is a HORRIBLE, DISHONEST, co mpany that has sent me no communications throughout this process. I NEVER asked for the loan to be deferred. I would have made payments to stop the bleeding if I knew I would ultimately be held responsible. THIS IS A CRIME!

Ive determined that my wife has been suffering from some sort of XXXX XXXX  and doesnt understand the gravity of not making mortgage payments timely. 

My wife indicates that she had previously requested forbearance under the CARES Act. After the foreclosure paperwork was received we received a demand for full payment of the loan. 

After receiving the foreclosure notice My wife applied for a mortgage assistance program and it took over a month to receive a denial with only a couple days left to appeal. 

The denial letter was dated XX/XX/XXXX. It was post marked XX/XX/XXXX. It allows 15 days from the date of the letter to appeal. 6 of those days expired BEFORE the letter was even mailed! 5 more expired while the letter was en route. 

Ive assumed responsibility for making mortgage and insurance payments for our family. I immediately began making payments of {$300.00} every two weeks via postal money order. I tried to establish a direct payroll draft but Midland has blocked that option for me. My payments were never posted to my account and returned by Midland. 

Midland posted a Deed in lieu of foreclosure on my credit report. At NO time did I consent to such an agreement. 

Ive provided proof of my income of over {$100000.00} per year to show my ability to make the mortgage payments. Ive been employed at my current employer for over XXXX  years so interruption of my income is not likely. Direct payroll draft would ensure that payments are made timely and regularly.

My intent is to fully pay off the mortgage at that time. I will double-check with the fund to see if they have a hardship policy for foreclosures that will allow me to bring the account current. 

I am fully ready and willing to resume regular payments of our mortgage. Midland Mortgage refuses to accept the payments. They seem to be on a fast track to sell my home.

The card was in her name and an "" aka '' was added to my credit report with my wife 's name. While reviewing the issue we found that they had used my wife 's name, but my SSN ( actually a variation of ) to issue credit. When I tried calling the company at first they could not find an account because the SSN they used does not match mine or my wifes SSN. We found out later that the SSN used was 1 number off of my SSN. When I explained that I did not apply for any credit with them my wife did, they said to send a copy of mine and my wifes license and SS cards so that they could rectify. After I sent in the info, my wife was told to not make payments yet as the account was under review. I sent this information 5 separate times because they kept saying they did not receive the fax. ( even though I have all of the copies saved showing they went through successfully. ) I then received another alert from XXXX XXXX that I had a late payment, sure enough when I checked it was this card, even though they told us just wait on paying until it was fixed they hit by credit anyway. 
Then after speaking with them they said they did not need my info only my wifes, so fax it again but this time with only my wifes info because sending mine with it was confusing them. So I sent just hers 3 more times. Finally in late XXXX when my wife called them back to make sure they received the most recent fax and she was told yes they received it, and that everything would be handled by that Friday ( 3 days from when she spoke with them ). 2 weeks later I receive another XXXX XXXX update stating that my credit had once again been dinged for nonpayment. 
I called them back, and this time was told that just because it had my wifes name on it did not mean anything. It was still under my ssn so I was responsible. The account manager told me that it was still not under my SSN it was 1 digit off, so what that tells her is that someone at their office messed it all up, and keyed it in wrong. When I explained again that I did not apply, my wife did with her information, she told me that what I was saying was not true and that my wife stole my info and used it. She then told me that they were canceling the current account and my wife would have to reapply, but that they would still not remove it from my Credit history even though they had the wrong ssn and my wife was telling them that this was her account, and she used her info to get it. She then told me fine, I will put it as fraud and you can try to get them to remove it that way. But we will send a fraud package out and you will have to handle it that way. 
The worst part is, my wife planned on paying this off the month after she used it. This account would have been paid in full back in XXXX, but they have told us to not make payments until they clear it up. 
Now I have several credit issues and my score has dropped over 100 points because of this. I am now not able to get the loans I need to refi my home, or even change cellphone carriers because ours does not work well at our new home. I have not had a single late payment on any bill in over 7 years. I worked very hard to make sure nothing ever touched my credit, and this company is now blatantly attempting to ruin my credit over a card that was never mine in the first place. 
We would pay this card completely off if the company would just fix the issue that they caused in the first place. If they move it to my wifes name and SSN and delete all history from the credit report from me. We do not think it is too much to ask for them to just rectify the issue that they caused. Instead of accusing my wife of theft and calling me a liar. 
I would be more than happy to give any other information needed. All faxes that I have sent them have been through a secure email fax through my companies email client, and I can show every time I sent it, along with the receipt showing that it was received. I am attaching the letter that my wife received from the company stating that SHE was approved for the card as evidence.

This loan was orchestrated under severe duress for fear of divorce. Both my husband and the loan officer knew of my objections and the fact that I did not want to sign the loan documents. I had repeatedly expressed my fear and duress about this type of loan. My duress was in emails as well as phone conversations. Under direct threat of divorce, I was required to close the loan. It was not until months later that I discovered they were planning another reverse mortgage however, this time, a jumbo reverse loan whereby I would have to sign a quit claim deed and hand over my trust fund as a "" gift '' deposit. This was a carefully orchestrated plan to protect my husband. Again, I was given the ultimatum to sign the quit claim deed, remove all marital interest and turn my deposit into a "" gift '' or my husband would file divorce papers. When I asked for different type of loan that had spousal protections, I was refused by my husband and told this was the only type of loan he could secure. After speaking to my trust attorney, I ultimately declined because of the risk. My husband filed for divorce within weeks of cancelling the loan. It was not until I found a letter detailing out how the reverse mortgage would benefit my husband in the event of divorce since I am the younger spouse. Both my husband and his loan officer knew this and orchestrated this loan with the intent to give him leverage to retain our marital home as well as the purchase of a new home. Through further investigation with my accountant, it was also discovered that my husband was paying this loan officer money outside of their mortgage company. These were large sums. Both my husband and this loan officer worked for the same finance company at the time and paying someone under the table for working on his loans while both were employed by the same company would be a breach in fiduciary duties as well as non reporting of overtime. This was not the only time my spouse and this loan officer committed mortgage fraud. In XXXX Both my husband and his loan officer knowingly closed loans as owner occupied for my husband 's son with the intent to gain a lower interest rate on a purchase. This property was never intended to be owner occupied. The house was already rented prior to closing the escrow. I was again under fear of divorce and physical harm if I exposed any of this information. Now that I have protection and legal representation, I can request an investigation. I have a reverse mortgage that should have never been consummated. I never agreed to the terms. I have emails and direct conversations with his loan officer as well as my husband which she would and could testify to my duress of the loan and my objection to signing the loan documents. The notary can also testify to my objections and duress I faced during the signing. I was under threat to sign the loan documents. It was not of my own free will.

PlusFour Inc is attempting to collect several debts for XXXX XXXX XXXX, after discovering these debts on my credit report, I attempted to get more information from XXXX XXXX XXXX but I was told to contact PlusFour Inc because these accounts are in collection and they refused to give more information on these accounts.

Right away I contacted PlusFour Inc to get a debt validation but they had never responded to my requests.

Since last year, I contacted PlusFour Inc and they had never provided any physical proof that these are my accounts. 

After I filed a complaint, I received a computer printout of these debts, these are no proof that these are my accounts, these statements showed that someone owe money to XXXX XXXX XXXX, but in no way these statements show that these are my debts as anyone can create any of these statements on any computer. 

PlusFour Inc was made aware that these accounts are not mine, is now over one year and they had never provided any physical verification as theyre required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act. 

They continue to report these accounts under my name after theyre were notified that the rightful owner of these accounts is my ex-wife. 

Reporting agencies are supposed to report accurate and truthful information but XXXX continue to report these accounts when they were made aware that these accounts are mine. 

XXXX had refused to proper investigate these accounts for proof that they belong to me, but they just go by a computer printout that shows an outstanding amount, these kinds of verification is harmful to the consumers because a computer printout is not a proof of ownership but these types of investigation save them money and time. 

I believe that PlusFour Inc doesnt have any physical proof, but the computer printout that they continue showing the credit bureaus and that is why they continue to use the tactics they had used so far.

PlusFour Inc and XXXX  are aware that these accounts are not mine, but they continue to report these accounts on my credit files. I had disputed these accounts with both XXXX and PlusFour Inc. 

The facts are, that I never been to XXXX XXXX XXXX for anything. 

My Ex-wife and my children are cover by my health insurance company that is why they have my name and social security for the purposes of filing insurance claims but, in no way, Im obligated to pay for any contract that my ex-wife gets into it. 

XXXX XXXX XXXX had summitted claims with the wrong social security number and that is why those accounts were never settled accordingly. 

Im not responsible for the claims that were summited incomplete and with errors by XXXX XXXX XXXX. 

I would had provided XXXX with any information they need it to process their claims, but I never received any communication from them or PlusFour Inc.

For the record I will like to file an official complaint against PlusFour Inc for failing to notify me of these debts before placing them on my credit reports and for failing to respond to debt validations. 
Also, for looking the way when they had been notified of the truth owner of these accounts, they just dont care. 

I discovered these collections after requesting my credit report. Immediately after discovering that PlusFour Inc had posted these negatives accounts on my credit report I disputed these accounts with XXXX  and I requested debt validations directly thru PlusFour Inc. XXXX is the only credit bureau that refused to remove this inaccurate information from my files, I had made XXXX  aware that these are not my accounts and told them the same thing over and over.

I dont understand what kind of investigation are XXXX  is conducting when clearly would show that these are not my accounts. 
XXXX is required by the Fair Credit Reporting Act that information reported is accurate but I dont believe that theyre following the law, since they continue to report inaccurate information on my file. 

Also, I like to express that my ex-wife didnt due anything wrong by using my credential for the purpose of Insurance claim. Since XXXX XXXX XXXX are provider to my insurance carrier my  ex-wife is only responsible for {$10.00} co-payments, so this doesnt make sense since she made all co-payments required before she visit the doctor.

3193403,2019-03-27,Credit card or prepaid card,General-purpose credit card or charge card,Problem with a purchase shown on your statement,Card was charged for something you did not purchase with the card,"I opened a credit card with Chase and was approved for their Amazon credit card in XXXX for the purposes of utilizing the rewards for purchases on the Amazon.com website. I frequently purchase items on Amazon and was attracted to this card for the 5 % rewards that were offered. I used the card VERY sparingly and was only buying amazon items and then sending in a payment to pay those items off. After receiving this card, I discovered that my now ex girlfriend had been stealing the card out of my wallet and making purchases without my knowledge and then returning the card to my wallet so it was not missing. At no time was she ever given permission to access my card nor was she ever an authorized user. She was simply my girlfriend at the time and we shared a residence. Our agreement was to pay the bills and split them evenly. She took care of the finances in our house, so she would tell me how much money to pay her each money to cover these expenses. After several months, I noticed that my credit cards, once being Chase, had numerous unauthorized charges and were items such as our power bill, cable billl, water bill, her cell phone, her car insurance and many many other items that were not authorized by myself. When confronted, she admitted to making the charges without my permission and stated she "" just didn't have the money to pay those bills '' because she was spending the cash I provided her to pay those bills and used the card to cover her debts. I was very angry and threatened to report her to the police since she was using the cards without my permission. I gave her 30 days to pay them off in full or I would report her to the police. 

Naturally before the 30 days was over I calmed down and was able to speak to her in more open frame of mind. She explained she tried to borrow the money from her parents and they said it was her deception and wrongdoing and they weren't going to bail her out by giving her the money. She stated she tried to borrow money in other manners but could not get the funds. She asked me to allow her to simply make the payments and pay the card off, although, she could not do that within 30 days. She informed me that when she received her tax returns should could probably pay the entire amount off. This conversation occurred roughly 1 year after receiving the card before I discovered the fraud. I agreed to this arrangement for only a few reasons. # 1 we lived together and having her arrested would negatively impact me as much as her because I relied on part of her income to help pay the bills. # 2. We were dating and I would be having my own girlfriend locked up who I did care for romantically and we had been in a long term relationship which could possibly progress further # 3. I had supported her solely for 6 months while she was unable to work to attend XXXX school. I had invested a significant amount of time and effort to assist her getting into XXXX school as well as caring for her children while she attended classes and then also began working part time during the night to cover expenses. As a result, turning her in would have made her a felon and that would have stopped her from becoming a XXXX  and would have wasted all of my effort to help her get where she was trying to improve herself. Also, if she was unable to become a XXXX due to a possible criminal record, it may be nearly impossible to pay off the credit cards which she had used without my permission and knowledge. At the time of this discovery, the balances of all 3 cards she was using without my consent was in the area of {$16000.00}. 

I agreed to let her pay monthly payment until the time she received her lump sum from a combination of school loan money and tax returns. The only problem is that when both the tax returns and student loan money came in months later, she had spent it, without paying as agreed, and then later told me she couldn't follow through. So she once again said not to worry, they will all be paid off within 12 months if I just gave her time. I agreed as I did not have much chose at that time and still believed she would handle the charges as promised. 

I later bought a home in XX/XX/XXXX and my girlfriend and her children moved in with me. It was on or about XX/XX/XXXX that I discovered she had still be using my credit cards, even though I had physically removed them from my home. I immediatly terminated the relationship due to this continued lack of trust and theft and kicked her out of my home. I started to pull together statements and verify information and found out my accounts totaled nearly 23k in credit card charges and she had been using my cards electronically. The now ex girlfriend showed me a notebook where she had copied down my full credit card numbers, expiration dates, security codes, full name, social, and birth date in order to continue to use these cards. She did not state that was the original reason for collecting this information. she stated she did that to be able to call in and make payments over the phone on my credit cards so the minimum payments were being made. I did not think about how she was making the payments towards the cards, but that the cards themselves were being paid. It now dawned on me that she had stolen my information and personal identity and was continuing to use that to verify information when using these cards electronically without physical access to these cards. This allowed her to continue top use the cards and keep me in the dark on the balances and still make the minimum payments to prevent any type of collection calls or letter to be sent to me. 

I demanded payment in full on these cards as a matter of restitution from the ex girlfriend after breaking off the relationship of 5 years. She informed me she would be happy to do this and was going to once again send me her school money in XXXX of XXXX  which would be XXXX and estimated she would have another $ XXXX from her tax returns and then would have one final student disbursement that she could pay to me to mostly pay off the balances. She assured me she could pay the amounts off in 12 months and she would be a XXXX  soon so that total would not be an issue with her newer higher paying job. I agreed only because she swore the money would be repaid and that allowed her to remain a XXXX with no legal action. The months came and went and no money was paid. I began to demand payment in full and near XXXX or XX/XX/XXXX she stated she had "" changed her mind '' just as I had done in regards to our relationship and I could just do what I wanted as she had no intentions of paying anything any longer. She also informed me she had spoken to a lawyer previously in the year and he was prepared to defend her in the event I wanted to sue her. However, she also stated that he had determined that the statute of limitations had already expired the previous month and she was no longer liable in civil court and I could try and sue her, but nothing would come of the case. It then dawned on me the entire reasons for these delays was to buy more time to let this statute of limitations pass at the advice of her attorney before telling me she no longer intended to pay on them as promised. Although she had written up a "" contract '' which was never signed agreeing to repay certain amounts of money she felt she owed, it was never executed or signed and therefore could not be enforced. 

I was furious and believed I was now fully responsible for these cards and she had left me responsible for all of her fraud and I would have to repay the amounts or face a judgement against me on my house which I had just purchased. I am barely surviving on the income I have and the {$700.00} minimum payments needed to be paid each month was crushing me financially. However, I was also mistakenly under the impression that I only had a time frame of 90 days to report the fraudulent charges are they were no longer able to be disputed on my behalf. Since the original fraudulent charge made on one credit card appeared to have occurred around XX/XX/XXXX with my XXXX XXXX, I believe I could no longer purse relief through the credit card companies. I began to shoulder all the payments of the minimums which was financially unbearable with a full mortgage to pay alone at {$880.00} per month, all utilities, a $ XXXX/mo student loan payment, and now an additional {$700.00} per month minimum credit card payment that was 2/3rds interest by the time the money was applied. This was unbearable and I feared I was going to lose my home over this fraudulent debt which I was saddled with. 

Finally in about XX/XX/XXXX I decided to go out on a limb and see if there was ANY alternative to assist me in paying off the credit cards. I was already completely broke with no savings and no furniture other than an air mattress for a bed because the ex had taken all of the furniture in my home since she owned it, including all blankets, pillows, even toiletries and left me with literally nothing. I had a plastic lawn chair as my only chair and the air mattress using borrowed blankets and pillows because I didn't have any extra money to purchase these basic items due to the credit card minimum payments. I was doing everything I could to survive, but the payments were too much burden on me to survive. I finally broke down and began to call the credit card companies involved including Chase, XXXX, and XXXX XXXX XXXX, I was overjoyed at first contact because all three cards informed me through their fraud department that I was NOT liable for charges I did not authorize and that were made by the ex. They stated my mistaken assumption of only having 90 days to report her fraud was incorrect and that they all had a zero fraud liability policy and they would make sure to remove those charges from my card and do a thorough fraud investigation on my behalf to hold her liable for her theft. 

I immediately began gathering evidence as requested by the fraud team members and provided statements with highlighted charges that were unauthorized on my cards. Within days of submitting these unauthorized charges, my accounts were being refunded and the charges were being taken off. Chase was the very first card to remove all charges from my account and I was at an approximately balance of negative {$10000.00}!!! I could not believe how any charges had been made by her over a 3 year period an discovered most of these charges were made by her in a shorter time frame of a year and a half due to the card only being open since XXXX. The negative balance was available to me to use as my refund and I was informed by a customer service operator that I could still use the card and any charges would come off as credited towards the negative balance. I was even told I could use the card to withdraw money as a "" cash advance '' but would be limited to my limit of {$600.00}. As a result, I requested a PIN number to be sent to me so that I could withdraw some cash and pay bills such as rent and other utilities that had been crushing me financially for so long. I used some of the money to get basic necessities like stock up on my groceries and get food in my freezer, buy items from XXXX and XXXX XXXX, and pay my mortgage and light bill without being completely broke for the first time in a long time. I also used some of the money to buy into a few small investments that I could not touch. Unfortunately, during the month of XXXX, my card suddenly stopped working when I still had a balance of negative XXXX. When I called into card services, I was transferred a department that then transferred me to a supervisor without ever explaining to me why I had no use of my card. Finally the supervisor in the card services explained my card had been shut off for excessive use of my credit line and the card had been cancelled! I asked why this was even possible since Chase still owed me {$2500.00} for my REFUND of fraudulently charged items, payments, and interest which had accrued and that my balance was as low as negative XXXX! The gentleman on the phone took a few minutes to review my account and then stated he saw what I was referring to and it appeared someone had made a mistake and cancelled the card believing I was running up and excessive balance on my card, when in reality, he could see I was using my refunded credit amount. I told him how I was told I could simply use the card as normal until my negative balance was exhausted and was doing exactly what I was instructed to do. I was trying to get back my refunded money that was stuck on that card. The supervisor stated he understood and was going to submit a request for my account to have a "" reconsideration '' to review the closure and that he would document that it was a misunderstanding and my account was not being excessively used other than to attempt to withdraw my refunded amount. He informed me the review process can take approximately 7 to 10 days, but to check back in a few more days. I did not check back on the status immediately, but instead, received a call on or about XX/XX/XXXX from a superior stating my card had been reviewed and they were reinstating my usage of the card. I had also previously asked what would become of my negative {$2500.00} when the card was "" cancelled '' and was informed that they would wait 7 days and the company would send me the refunded credit as a check to ensure any pending charges were posted to my account. I thanked them for their help and waited to receive my check. Once my card was reinstated, I realized that they were not going to send the check since I now had access to the balance and there for used it to pull {$1500.00} off towards another small investment and would later request they company mail me a check for the remaining {$1000.00} which would leave the card with a balance of {$0.00}. I was finally stress free and realizing I could not get my furniture I so desperately needed and would not have to stress about how to buy food when I could barely afford my mortgage with these credit card payments. 

Unfortunately my happiness and excitement did not last long because I received another phone call Monday afternoon from a woman who identified herself as the fraud investigator assigned to my case. I can not remember the womans name, but I was given her contact information as XXXX, extension XXXX. This fraud investigator stated she had concluded "" her '' investigation and decided that the charges reported were NOT FRAUD because my ex was "" given access to these cards by me because she lived with me ''. I immediately stopped her and informed her that I had NEVER given her access and she was mistaken, someone obviously had made a mistake on the file. The investigator stated that she had NOT made any mistake, and that since the person who committed this fraud lived with me, she naturally would have had access to my cards by simply going into my dresser or wallet to take these cards and use them, even if I didn't give her permission to do so. 

After hearing this comment, I was LIVID with such as careless point of view that she was suggesting I was to blame for this fraud because simply LIVING with someone was enough grounds to determine they "" might '' take your card some day and use it without your permission and put it back. As a result, by them living in your residence, it is now your fault even though we have NEVER been married and she was NEVER an authorized user on my card. This made no sense to me and I immediately told this supervisor I could not believe someone could steal a credit card from me, use it, and put it back and it was acceptable simply because she lived at my residence. This would mean that absolutely ANYONE who had a roommate or child, or even just a friend living with them would be exposed to this same credit card fraud because she is blaming the victim for someone living in their home! The investigator stated that "" Well sir, we are a financial institution and we simply can not refund these charges because you allowed her to use them since she was living there and as a result she knew how to gain access to the cards. '' I wish that this phone conversation had not been as devastating as it was, but then the investigator continued to tell me she had more bad news. The investigator stated that Chase had "" mistakenly double refunded the charges and as a result we are putting approximately {$13000.00} back on your card because we accidentally made a {$6000.00} mistake ''. I tried to stop her and ask for more of an explanation of HOW could this POSSIBLY HAPPEN! How can a financial institution make such a stupid error and tell me they made a {$6000.00} mistake and were telling me that they were now going to add this back onto my card along with all charges she whimsically decided to deny refunds on for a balance of {$13000.00} on a single credit card that only had a maximum credit limit of {$3500.00}!! This means that if she would follow through with this decision, the banks unforgivable mistake would end up making me look like I had a balance that exceeded my credit limit by over {$10000.00} and absolutely DESTROY my credit rating in the process! They would also be charging me the feels that would make withdrawing the money from the ATM 's as my refund appear to be cash advances at the rate of 27 % on top of 23 % for the fraudulent charges. The minimum payments on this card would absolutely bankrupt me and I was the victim of fraud! How could this even be acceptable for someone to be the victim of fraud, try to resolve the situation on behalf of the credit card companies by making payments and even trying to get thief to pay the funds back in full, and then victimize me a second time by taking all the money back, hitting me with THEIR {$6000.00} mistake because someone miscalculated and told me that money was mine to use, and then now want it back after it has been spent? All while I was promised in the beginning that these fraudulent charges would not be my responsibility from the very day I called! If I had known this is how terrible the service was and that the credit card companies could not even figure out how to do their own refunds properly without making any mistakes, I would never have opened the card to begin with. That way I could never have been victimized through the fraud by Chase and their guarantee that I had "" zero fraud liability '' and was protected. That is apparently not true because their investigator simply wanted to find a way to blame ME for the charges when they could't find any other way to deny the claim, she would make a ridiculous conclusion that simply living with her negated the fraud and was now my responsibility. I did not receive these  same statements from XXXX XXXX XXXX nor XXXX XXXX and XXXX lost FAR more money than Chase in the theft in the amount of nearly {$31000.00} alone. Yet, they have refunded the amounts and asked for affidavits of fraud and any assistance of criminal prosecution of my ex girl friend. Chase did not even so much as offer me an affidavit to sign for fraud and I have offered on numerous occasions to assist them with any criminal charges should they choose to pursue that avenue. I once again informed this same fraud investigator that I would be willing to assist with a criminal investigation to assist them as I was doing the same with XXXX card, yet she said to her this was entirely civil and they were not going to refund any money. She did not care that her decision was unfounded and had no compassion that her decision is going to wreck my financially and destroy my credit. So, I immediately told the investigator that I wanted this decision appealed to a supervisor for review as I did not feel her determination was one based on any factual reasoning that was a legitimate law or policy. She stated that she could try to get a supervisor on the phone but they were busy, or she could resubmit this case to a department but that they would need to do another full investigation. I told her that would be find as I knew that these charges were fraudulent and I would not allow her to call these unauthorized charges my responsibility based on her statement my ex-girlfriend could make those charges simply because she lived in the same house hold. Why would ANYONE ever need an authorized user card then? Apparently she believed you can just take someone's card behind their back and use it and it would be perfectly acceptable! So, I stated I wanted the review done on my decision and the account to be looked at by another person above her with more authority. I told her I wanted this account left alone since adding this XXXX back onto my card was an unfair burden on both me and my credit and that would cause me even further damage. The investigator simply stated that "" The file will be submitted for review and further investigation '' and my full belief is she understood I was appealing her decision and asking for someone else to review this account and stay her reversal onto my card. I am now looking at my account today and realizing that this investigator did the exact opposite and I now have all charges put back onto my card with a balance of {$13000.00} with no available credit and over the limit by {$9500.00}!. My credit rating which was severely harmed from the fraudulent credit card charges will not be even FURTHER destroyed just as I began to recover. There is no possible way I can in good conscience make payments on charges I know are both fraud due to theft and also mistakes made by the same company that promised to protect me should this happen. Instead both parties are further harming me financially by making me liable for them and I am the victim! It is unimaginable to me to think any reputable company would be so callous, reckless, and irresponsible to the victim of a crime and then further harm them by claiming they "" accidentally '' made a mistake of {$6000.00}! That is not MY fault that they made that mistake as they were the ones who informed me I could spend this money as it was MINE! I would NEVER charge {$6000.00} on a credit card in this manner as I am far more financially responsible that this and I feel as they have now baited me into a trap and are trying to wash their hands of their own responsibility for both the fraud and their "" error '' of double refunding me charges. I am NOT able to pay this money back and I do not have the the ability to make the massive monthly payments their error will incur on me. This is simply not something I can ever forget and I will likely be forced to switch my credit card accounts to another company in the future as I feel there was never any intention to help me with being defrauded by this investigator. I will make sure to tell everyone I know to cancel any credit card, bank account, investment product and any other item they may have with Chase or any Chase bank due to how I was treated and how they have proven their word of "" zero fraud liability '' really doesn't actually apply and superficial reasons will be made up that do not even exist in their card polices. 

So in other words, Chase will make up whatever story they want and try to blackmail you into paying off someone else 's illegal charges while offering NO protection and threaten damage to your credit, employment, liens and judgments on your home, and ultimately the shame of having a destroyed credit report committed by someone who was never held responsible for their fraudulent charges to begin with. I have never felt more violated in my life than I do right now and I have never felt more hopeless and depressed than I do now because I can not possibly pay this money back and nor should I have to.

2986706,2018-08-08,Mortgage,Conventional home mortgage,Struggling to pay mortgage,,"I filed for a mortgage modification through XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX twice. I was granted a trial modification both times. However, due to actions of OCWEN I was not permitted a final modification. I recently went through a divorce, and I am XXXX. In short, these are the reasons for needing the modification, along with my now ex-wife stealing our mortgage money and giving it to her parents. 
The first modification I was approved for was a HAMP in XX/XX/XXXX. 
The Hamp modification was delivered to my mail box on either XX/XX/XXXX, or XX/XX/XXXX if I remember right, it was approximately 3 weeks into  XX/XX/XXXX. The first letter that was received stated the first payment was due XX/XX/XXXX the the following week I received a letter with the actual modification agreement with the payment schedule. Just prior to receiving these letters I had filed for legal aid through 'Legal aid of XXXX Ohio ',  because they were continually telling me they weren't receiving documents and papers I was sending them. Now I received a letter the third week of XX/XX/XXXX telling me my first payment was due over a month and a half prior to receiving it, and a package the fourth week of XX/XX/XXXX stating the first payment was due XX/XX/XXXX first. Both of these documents stated that if I did not make all three trial payments on time I could not be granted a permanent modification. The attorney was no help. I needed verification that since I was already one to two months late, depending on what I went by, that I wouldn't be refused a permanent modification. Ocwen wouldn't speak to me since I had an attorney, and when I was able to get ahold of the attorney he just kept blowing me off and saying it wouldn't be a problem and just make the payments that weren't made on time. So They refused my modification. Then in, I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX, I hired XXXX XXXX from XXXX XXXX XXXX  in XXXX, Ohio. She really pulled one over on me. She told me how not only was she going to stop the foreclosure, but make OCWEN make all the missed payments, and how she was going to sue them for wasting my time, etc. You know the spill. She also talked me into joining some class action lawsuit a supposed colleague of hers in XXXX was filing. I never heard from them, and all she told me was that this attorney use to be the Attorney General of Ohio. I gave her a {$1000.00} cash down payment and was suppose to pay her {$500.00} a month. She lead me to believe that this would be taken care of in approximately two months. After the first month I quit paying her. She also mysteriously didn't have numerous documents that I gave to her, and was on vacation for several weeks during this time she was suppose to be getting this taken care of for me. 
This leads me to the most current issue at hand, and the main reason for this complaint. I had almost given up hope, but finally decided to try again. So, in, I believe XX/XX/XXXX, I filed again for a mortgage modification. After a couple months of constantly having to Re-Send numerous documents to OCWEN, which they already already had for two years, I was turned down for a modification. They claimed I did not provide them with all of the necessary documents they requested even though I had fax receipts showing they received them. I actually had a lady from XXXX on a three way call, I believe the end of XX/XX/XXXX, and she got them to admit that the documents did come to them but there was a problem with the fax machine on their end, but I was still denied. Anyway, In XX/XX/XXXX I start hearing from family and friends that my home is on the county website for auction on XX/XX/XXXX, and then receive a letter from OCWEN on XX/XX/XXXX ( That's when it arrived in my mail box ) That my home was going to be auctioned off on XX/XX/XXXX. To make a long story short, I filed for an emergency bankruptcy on Friday XX/XX/XXXX and faxed it and emailed it to OCWEN and hand delivered it to the Sheriff 's office the same day to stop the sale. I then filed for another modification in XX/XX/XXXX. I mailed it certified and video taped every document inside of the package and me mailing it and attached it to the email to OCWEN. In XX/XX/XXXX I was approved for a trial modification the three payments were due XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately called OCWEN to remind them that I don't get paid until the XXXX of the month and they said if I mailed it out anytime the first week of the month it would be fine. So, I made all three of the payments like I was suppose to, but the final modification wasn't here the first week of XX/XX/XXXX when my next payment was due, so I called them. I told them that I wanted to make my next payment but the final modification papers weren't here for me to review. This was approximately XX/XX/XXXX. The individual I spoke to told me they were still being prepared and that they would be sent out soon. I told him that I felt they should have been done and sent already so that I could make my payment on time. 
He told me I could still make the payment. I explained to him that I had a right to review the documents first and after all of the mistakes that had been made with my account I felt I should review them first. I called them back the following week and was told they were going out in the next few days. I didn't receive them until, I believe it was XX/XX/XXXX. Just prior to this on about XX/XX/XXXX, I decided that I should at least mail in the payments so I didn't start getting behind and argue about the paperwork later, so I mailed them two checks. One for XX/XX/XXXX and one for XX/XX/XXXX. After I received the documents around the XXXX, I signed and notarized them and mailed them back on the XXXX or XXXX. Later in XX/XX/XXXX, I don't recall the date, I received the two checks back in the mail stating the amount wasn't enough to bring my account current. So I immediately set up an appointment with my account manager for the first available date he had open, which he didn't keep and had to reschedule. About a week after I received the checks back I received a letter denying my modification stating they had never received the signed agreement ( The one they mailed to me a month late ). I just found the dates. The earliest appointment I could get with my account manager was tuesday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX, which he didn't keep so I rescheduled for Friday XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX. During this conversation He told me that they never received the signed modification papers. I explained to him how the papers weren't here when they should have been, how I went ahead and sent the checks in before even receiving the modification, and that I did sign and notarize the papers and sent them back. I also reminded him of the numerous other times they claimed not to receive documents and how they even admitted to a third party ( the lady from XXXX that they did receive documents they claimed not to receive and it was an error on their part. I got him to agree to let me resend the checks and the modification package. He said as long as they received it by the end of the day on XX/XX/XXXX that would be fine. He told me that now I had to go have my ex-wife sign this document too. Now, from day one in XX/XX/XXXX all the way until this time, they had Never required her signature for anything. None of the applications for modification or anything else. I would always just put a line through her name. They have been sent the quit claim deed three times now. My ex-wife, XXXX XXXX, has discharged this debt in a bankruptcy. She has No financial obligation to OCWEN and no rights to the deed. I re-explained this to him again, and he said it would be too much work to take her name off. I told him I didn't care how much work it was, that I wasn't asking her to sign it, and that she wouldn't do it for me anyway. I told him that ever since they found out I was XXXX and receiving social security, they have been making excuse after excuse and running me in circles sending the same documents over and over. Not sending me things on time and then holding it against me. I reminded him that I have done everything they have asked me, and I made my payments on time. I told him she don't live here, owe you any money or have a right to this property in any way, so why does she have to be on my loan modification. He then tried to say that the modification had to be the same as the deed was recorded in the county. I then told him, if the modification has to reflect what the county has, then you are doing it wrong, because the county showed me, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX and the only property owner and that her name was not recorded as the property owner with the county Auditor. I told him I was going to get a copy of my property description and another copy of the quit claim from the county and send it to them. He told me to get them and send it in with the notarized and signed documents by the end of the day on Friday XX/XX/XXXX and he would try and get it worked out if he could. Monday XX/XX/XXXX, I received a letter from Ocwen stating that my modification was being turned down. Today XX/XX/XXXX, they came to my door and handed me a letter stating that my home was going to be auctioned in a month, an exact date has not been set at this time. Also, in OCWEN 'S last letter to me stating I was being turned down, they did say I could request another modification. What a joke. I noticed while reviewing the permanent modification that they were double charging me for the missed payments too. They were charging me for principle and interest for that period, but not deducting it from the loan amount. Also, charging me for overpriced insurance that only covered their property and none of mine. 
I have done everything this company has asked me to do to keep my home, but some of the things they are doing are just wrong, and not possible. If my ex-wife was still in debt to them I could understand making her stay on the new loan, but she's not, nor does she have any claim to this property.

XX/XX/XXXX To Whom it May Concern, I earned my XXXX XXXX XXXX at XXXX XXXX XXXX. I attended that institution from XXXX to XXXX. Back then, I never paid more than {$1600.00} per year {$800.00} per semester. I consolidated all my loans after my graduation and started paying {$300.00} per month for a couple of years. At that time I was making {$28000.00} working for the XXXX XXXX XXXX as an XXXX XXXX. 
During this period I married XXXX XXXX XXXX. He decided that I was using too much money for myself by paying my own loan, because I was the only one working and was the breadwinner for XXXX of us. So he was determined to find a way for his debt to be paid even though he wasnt working. 

In XXXX, Navient in complicity with my husband deceitfully misguided me into a joint consolidated loan. My husband was verbally abusive, calling me selfish, unfit mother and used all kind of threats and intimidation to stop me from paying my loan. He contrived a plan to consolidate his debt with mine and a navient customer service representative convinced me that it was in my best interest. This representative claimed that this would be the best deal I would ever have, if I consolidated with my husband. I reiterated that my student loans were consolidated previously. The Navient agent kept on telling me : "" Great! You still can consolidate and it is going to be in your best interest. The agent provided me with unclear and deceitful information such as : 1- I can re-consolidate with my husband even though I have already consolidated. 
2- The joint consolidation will decrease my interest from 6 % to only 2 %. 
My husbands plan was to make me pay the entire loan myself. I did pay it from XXXX to XXXX until my husband forced me to resign at the XXXX XXXX and move to Florida. There, I continued paying until XXXX. Unfortunately, it is after this move to Florida that I learned my husband had been XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, since she was XXXX. He wanted us to be away from family and friends so he could XXXX XXXX XXXX without the watchful eye of those who loved me and my children. At this point, I was still with my husband and he was working and he did not pay his fair share. Instead, he put pressure on me and tried to force me to sign for forbearance. After I knew about better options, I refused to sign for forbearance. My husband then forged my signature in order to get a forbearance. I informed Navient about it, they told me they can not do anything. 
The XXXX XXXX that I suffered and knowledge of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX led to my divorce. After this traumatizing event, I was unemployed for 7 years trying to rebuild and recover from such damaging period in my life. I informed Navient about the aforementioned facts and reiterated that I am currently unemployed. Navient never informed me about loan forgiveness and/or income driven repayment. In fact, it kept on steering me toward multiple forbearances. I just learned if you work for a XXXX XXXX for 10 years, your school loan can be forgiven, I was with the XXXX XXXX for 6 years. If Navient did not fail to inform me, I would have fought to stay with the organization  until I retired. 
I know that my student loans were around {$10000.00}. I had paid {$300.00} for 3 years before re-consolidating with my husband in XXXX. Then I continued paying for 3 more years until my abusive ex-husband forced me to resign another job. From my calculations I have paid off 80 % of the debt that I previously had. On top of it, I paid Navient for 3 more years after the deceitful re-consolidation. I do not understand how I ended up owing {$78000.00} to Navient ( seven times what I owed in the beginning )? Please, help me sort this out and allow me every concession possible in order to reduce this debt to a reasonable amount. I ask that you waive fees, reduce the interest and present a payment plan that is reasonable and that also requires my ex-husband to be responsible for his portion of the debt. 

Please bear in mind that I am currently unemployed due to XXXX XXXX wickedness and I explain : XXXX and I have an XXXX  son of whom we share a joint custody. My son is in XXXX XXXX and he goes to school from XXXX to XXXX. On the week my son is with me, my employer allowed me to work 30 hours as to be home upon my son arrival.

XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX dispute came back as a verified account. 
I contacted Wells Fargo and was told by them I was JOINT in the account. I told them I was never aware of being added as a JOINT account holder and have had no access of knowledge of the account or usage for many years. I tried to dispute but they said I would require a police report to open any investigation of fraud. 

XXXX XXXX Ex husband said that he verified I was still listed on his personal line of credit and tried to remove me at a Wells Fargo branch and was told that it was impossible because the account "" wasn't set up that way.

I kept trying to resolve by calling Wells Fargo but kept getting nowhere. I asked for verification that I applied for this account jointly - they said they had none on file.

XX/XX/XXXX - Went to the police department to file a report for fraud since these were NOT my charges, not my delinquent reports, and NOT my responsibility. I was told by the officer I had to go in to the local branch and obtain a letter verifying fraudulent activity before they would pursue it. 

Went directly to the local branch and met with a banker.

The banker said I should not have any responsibility with the account and should be able to be removed but somehow I was added as a "" co-borrower '' which made the account read as JOINT. She called multiple representatives and we spent over an hour trying to find out how this happened - with no answer or resolution. 

I was given a CASE # XXXX and told an investigation would be started to verify what happened and remove me from the account. I was told to wait a few days and call for an update.

I explained that there are a number of ways to verify my identity in a secure fashion and DEMANDING i have a physical card to reset my online password is ridiculous. I said they could send me a piece of mail to my home address, i said you could text me a new password or email me a new password, however, they insist that i will now always have to make my payments and check my transactions by phone or by paper.

i believe this policy exists to entice people into ensuring that people like myself who are trying to get out of credit card debt have copies of their cards so that they are more likely to use them. I am sure statistically people who have a card in their wallet are more likely to use credit services than if they do not have a card.

I did not know that XXXX  sold and transferred this account. NCB Management Service is a third party debt collector. There are several issues with how this account is currently being reported. First, NCB is reporting ( 90 ) days past due with a starting date of XX/XX/XXXX. A collection account is considered a continuation of the original debt. It is a violation of law for a collection agency to report old past-due amounts as if they are new again when the debts are sold. If an agency persists in reporting old debts with updated activity dates, this could result in a legal case against the third party collection agency. Second, there is no date being reported for last active which is a violation of the Fair Credit Reporting Act. This account should be reporting a {$0.00} balance and {$0.00} past due. I have made numerous attempts to resolve this issue directly with XXXX  XXXX  however, I was not successful and consequently this account now is with NCB Management Service.

After submitting a complaint a generic response was sent back by XXXX that provided absolutely no factual information nor any valid defense to their decision to remain "" unchanged '' as they stated on their decision to falsely report information against me that was the result of credit card fraud and identity theft. XXXX XXXX  is engaging in a tactic using generic responses without actually providing proof they have investigated my claim as well as submitting information based on how they "" feel '' not what is based on fact or law. They have routinely denied my claim for this account to be removed from my credit even when presented with copies of the police report that document the fact I am the victim of fraud and identity theft and even provided them the name of the person who is the theif. Their response is that they "" feel '' the complaint is civil as the person involved is an ex-girlfriend but they fail to examine the actual laws that govern this case and prove this is not civil nor that how they "" feel '' can suddenly make the case a civil case simply because they do not wish to actually charge off an account due to this criminal activity and instead have openly and incorrectly demanded I collect the money myself. This is now how the legal system works and XXXX XXXX  is not immune to the consequences of violating the Fair Credit Billing Act or the fact that at least 4 state statutes in North Carolina directly define my situation as criminal fraud as well as two Federal  Statutes. XXXX XXXX  is not investigating in good faith or they would be able to see within minutes that the following statutes cover my case of being the victim of fraud and have no legal standing to push off my case as "" civil ''. Lastly, XXXX is making inaccurate statements that they are attributing to me in their investigation that I never made. XXXX is stating I claim this person "" handled my finances '' which is not true, XXXX has claimed in the past that I gave this person permission to use my cards, which is also false, and most recently XXXX has made the allegation that this account is a civil matter due to my request to "" pay me back '' the stolen funds, which is also untrue. I have never asked her to pay me, I instructed that she payoff the stolen cards, or face criminal charges, which is exactly what has occurred. XXXX has submitted falsified information as part of their "" investigation '' in this case which they never gathered from me, but somehow found this information in their report as if I was even spoken to about this complaint. XXXX has not spoken to me regarding this fraudulent activity since the initial filing almost two years ago and has not validated anything they reported on that investigation. They then continue to use this same misinformation and use statements against me that I never made as proof of their results of the investigation, yet refuse to take actual signed affidavit 's of fraud which I offered to them the day I filed the claim. XXXX is falsifying information and relying on fundamentally faulty information which is counter to the law. So, to provide proof once again XXXX is wrong in their claim of this being a "" civil '' matter I am attaching all relevant statutes, both state and Federal, which directly contradict statements made by XXXX XXXX. The following State of North Carolina Statutes define the charges made by the ex on my credit card as fraud : 14-113.9. Financial transaction card theft. ( a ) A person is guilty of financial transaction card theft when the person does any of the following : ( 1 ) Takes, obtains or withholds a financial transaction card from the person, possession, custody or control of another without the cardholder 's consent and with the intent to use it ; or who, with knowledge that it has been so taken, obtained or withheld, receives the financial transaction card with intent to use it or to sell it, or to transfer it to a person other than the issuer or the cardholder 14-113.13. Financial transaction card fraud. XXXX a ) A person is guilty of financial transaction card fraud when, with intent to defraud the issuer, a person or organization providing money, goods, services or anything else of value, or any another person, he ( 1 ) Uses for the purpose of obtaining money, goods, services or anything else of value a financial transaction card obtained or retained, or which was received with knowledge that it was obtained or retained, in violation of G.S. 14-113.9 or 14-113.11 or a financial transaction card which he knows is forged, altered, expired, revoked or was obtained as a result of a fraudulent application in violation of G.S. 14-113.13 ( c ) ; or ( 2 ) Obtains money,  goods, services, or anything else of value by : a.

Fraudulent use of credit cards ; penalties ( a ) Use, attempt or conspiracy to use card in transaction affecting interstate or foreign commerce Whoever knowingly in a transaction affecting interstate or foreign commerce, uses or attempts or conspires to use any counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit card to obtain money, goods, services, or anything else of value which within any one-year period has a value aggregating {$1000.00} or more ; or ( d ) Receipt, concealment, etc., of goods obtained by use of card Whoever knowingly receives, conceals, uses, or transports money, goods, services, or anything else of value ( except tickets for interstate or foreign transportation ) which ( 1 ) within any one-year period has a value aggregating {$1000.00} or more, ( 2 ) has moved in or is part of, or which constitutes interstate or foreign commerce, and ( 3 ) has been obtained with a counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit card ; or ( f ) Furnishing of money, etc., through use of card Whoever in a transaction affecting interstate or foreign commerce furnishes money, property, services, or anything else of value, which within any one-year period has a value aggregating {$1000.00} or more, through the use of any counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained credit card knowing the same to be counterfeit, fictitious, altered, forged, lost, stolen, or fraudulently obtained shall be fined not more than {$10000.00} or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both Because these charges were made by someone without my knowledge and without my permission and criminal felony charges were taken out, my account is covered under the legal definition of fraudulent activity and must be deleted under the XXXX guarantee of zero fraud guarantee protection. Any attempt to call this civil is a direct violation of my rights under the Federal protection of the Fair Credit Billing Act as well as the North Carolina General Statutes.

I have brought up this same issue directly with the credit agencies Experian and Equifax who have also failed to do their due diligence in verifying the information is valid. I have asked for copies of their investigation of how they arrived at the decision that the information provided was accurate after sending copies of the police report and filing identity theft and credit card theft against the perpetrator. All I ever received is a false promise by telephone through an agent that it would be received within 30 days. This was in XX/XX/XXXX and I have yet to receive any validated documentation on their "" investigation '' as there is none to provide. I personally believe that they are simply taking the false information that XXXX XXXX XXXX is providing and simply stating "" Ok, that's what we will put on his credit '' and not actually completing any investigation to verify the validity of the information they are reporting. A police report for identity and credit card theft that includes their account should be more than enough evidence that what XXXX XXXX XXXX is sending them is the result of fraud and Identity theft as the police report states. I would welcome the company contacting the police department and speaking to someone in investigations as well and verifying the report is genuine and the result of me being a victim of fraud and credit card theft as well as identity theft. Lastly, I have attached copies of the above referenced statutes that nullify XXXX XXXX XXXX 's claim that I owe money because they "" feel '' an ex girlfriend stealing credit cards is civil. XXXX XXXX XXXX is intentionally making false claims that were never made on my behalf. I never provided my credit cards voluntarily to allow the ex girlfriend to use them, I never agreed to allow her access to them, I never provided her with my account information. All of these statements by XXXX XXXX were made by them, they were never made by me. They "" assumed '' that is what occurred according to the initial investigator. XXXX XXXX XXXX can not provide ANY documentation or statements from me that say otherwise because it never happened. I was stolen from and my accounts were used fraudulently. This account is the result of that fraud and I have followed all chains of command and provided all requested documentation to provide this proof of fraudulent activity. As stated in the provided North Carolina laws as well as Federal Laws, I am the victim of fraud, the crimes committed against me are felony charges and the proper authorities have been notified and charges have been filed as you can see in the attached police report. There should be no other reasons why this account remains on my credit needlessly damaging my credit report unless it is an intentional act. Refusal to remove this from my credit bureau with fully verifiable information showing the activity is fraud will result in additional action through the court system seeking damages under the fair credit reporting act as well as requesting punitive damages in addition to any court ordered restitution. I have requested this removal of incorrect information more than a dozen times over the past two years and no one has once contacted me through any investigation or made any more of an effort than to simply respond with "" verified by account holder ''. That is not an investigation, that is a copy an paste job of incorrect information. This account must be deleted immediately.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",NC,27530,,Consent provided,Web,2020-07-17,Closed with explanation,Yes,

I am divorcing my wife. At this time it is necessary to get a full pulse on my financial health. I recently visited XXXX XXXX and was shocked : Over the course of our marriage, my wife has opened up dozens of credit cards in my name, without my knowledge. The worst of which - XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXS. Please see the attached screenshot I took. My wife secretly opened the card in my name over two years ago, and in that time, PNC also allowed her to run up the balance to nearly {$13000.00}. 

Note that the card was opened on XX/XX/XXXX. Let me be perfectly clear : I have never opened a credit card in my life. After confronting my wife, she admitted to using my personal information, without my knowledge, to open this account. It took PNC some time to direct me to someone for help. 

I first spoke to a fraud agent on XX/XX/XXXX. She was polite and ready to help me any way she could. I was upset, but she was trying to help, and she let me get my story across. I told her I needed the statements from the time my wife opened the account up to today. She immediately obliged and sent an email with an attachment containing the statements and a fraud kit, I think she said. The trouble was, I was unable to open the zipped attachment to see the contents. 

I called PNC again later that day, or early the next day. I eventually got to the fraud department, but was still unsure who I was talking to. I didn't know if I was talking to someone in customer service in general, or the fraud department. I was told that an agent my case. I was unaware a case had even been opened up. Poor communication on the part of PNC. I followed up with the agent several times, but received only a voicemail ; I left several messages, but got no return call. This went on for a few days. Again, I didn't know I had been assigned to the fraud team. I eventually found their number. Instead of hearing from the agent assigned, I was left a message by someone else from the fraud team, and I ended up playing phone tag with her for a few additional days. I had provided my work and my cell number ; however, I was not contacted at work, and at the end of each day, I only had a message from the fraud team. I was not being helped in a swift manner ; at this point I was not being helped at all. 

Long story short, I was left waiting for far too long. I was given no details about my case, and PNC did not make clear the process they had started. As I said, I didn't know I had been assigned someone from fraud until days after I had first called PNC. All the information I had to that point was from XXXX XXXX ; nothing from PNC. I didn't even know the last four digits of the card number. A card that I never opened. As I said, my wife had opened it using my personal information, and she hid the mailed statements from me. This is an absurd situation, and PNC is a part of it. I did not open an online PNC account, nor did I apply for a credit card. And yet here is my name associated with the card. 

So while I'm waiting, the late fee and interest was intact, and I was billed still. This has taken a severe toll on my emotional and financial health. What about PNC 's best practices? Do you even practice ethical, sound business practices? I was violated. Am I to understand that PNC prides themselves on protecting customers? If so, how was I victimized? I'm not even a customer. I didn't open the card, and I am not the card holder. So why is my name on the card, and why is this seriously affecting my credit score? 

I've held a joint checking account at PNC with my wife for at least ten years ; that checking account is now closed. I did so for my own protection, but also because of what PNC did to me. Eventually someone in Retail Escalations spoke with me and hinted that if my wife had been paying using our joint checking account, even if I didn't know about it, the fraud team would probably not rule in my favor. I was so tired of waiting on PNC I just gave in. I even wrote them a letter and thanked them for their honesty ; I wish now I had not. In working with other credit card companies, I've come to understand PNC 's practices and investigations were not the same nor sound, and that in at least one case, XXXX  XXXX, the XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX confirmed that the account my wife opened up with them was fraudulent. And yet with PNC, they continue to victimize the victim. 

My divorce lawyer advised me that since my wife admitted to fraudulently opening up the card, with my name associated with it, to not call the police. He advised me to request the statements from when my wife opened up the account over two years ago, up to today ( as I mentioned earlier ), and to contact PNC and pay the monthly amount. He advised me to present him with all of this up until the divorce, in hope that my wife will rightly be responsible for the {$13000.00} balance. In the meantime, I'm doing as instructed, and it is the ethical thing. The right thing. What does PNC plan to do? How do they plan to do right by me? I was victimized, and PNC 's poor practices allowed this. They made it easy. 

So with late fees and interest, the next payment due was {$1500.00}. How was I supposed to pay that when I just found out about the card a few weeks prior? As you may see from the XXXX XXXX data, my wife had been making sporadic payments, and my credit and debt, totally unbeknownst to me, was getting worse. I had to call PNC and make a deal with them to get on a 'hardship ' payment plan. I've never had to do anything like that in my life, and it was humiliating. 

As I mentioned, there are dozens of cards my wife opened over the years, without my knowledge. I am paying XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX XXXX, etc. All cards I didn't open, and didn't know about. How am I to protect myself when my wife is hiding the statements from me?

One had a limit of $ XXXX and the other $ XXXX. I notified Chase and filed a police report. The fraud included a gentleman facilitating phone calls and posing as me. Both parties have been charged. Immediately Chase told me that they would close the account, reverse the charge and issue a new card. I closed my bank account, and Chase told me to not only do that but go to my bank and request a return of payments that were connected to my account. About three days later, Chase called and said that since i had been a beneficiary of the fraud, even though it was unknowingly, they could not substantiate it as fraud. I agreed to handle the process through the courts to seek the return of property acquired and restitution. In the interim, I attached a new bank account and returned the funds that they had returned to my bank, as well as made another payment. Though the fraud was only on the Sapphire card, I found that both cards said "" account closed '' when I logged on. The specialist I talked to promised me that I would be issued new accounts, and I need only continue with my payments. When I called to speak with Chase about the accounts being closed, they offered that they had done a random credit check, and though no other accounts on my credit report had changed, they cited "" a rapid increase in balance '' which was the fraud on the Sapphire card, and ( 2 ) a returned payment, which they informed me to pursue. I have never made a late payment with them, even with the fraud occurring. Further the balance of the other card that was not affected was $ XXXX of $ XXXX, which I was logging on to pay. I had previously opted out of pre-screening offers, so their rationale that this was a random credit check was bogus and an outright act of deceit. The other card is at $ XXXX of $ XXXX with the fraud. The fraud included one major purchase that the woman and her accomplice made, so I am unsure of how a rapid increase of spending is justified. I believe that this is unfair and deceptive business practice, as all of the actions taken were under the advisement of Chase.

( attachment B ) 2 ) Violation of their own policy regarding authorized users of account - 5/3 bank put me on my ex-husband 's account as "" user-spouse '' ( attachment C ) even though he did not authorized the bank to do so. 
When he requested my name to be removed, 5/3 bank employees ( multiple ) said "" it can not be done '' He did so multiple times. Last occasion was yesterday, when the Bank 's employee- Ms XXXX XXXX said the same as many others before : '' it can not be done ''. And she also added : '' by the way, that account was closed on your ex-wife 's request on XXXX. '' This was simply a lie. The account was closed by 5/3 bank on XX/XX/XXXX. See attachment C. 
3 ) lying to the customer/misleading the customer - I went to multiple branches of 5/3 bank, talked to multiple people, the reply was always the same "" don't worry about it ''. 
4 ) gross negligence that caused harm to the customer - as the result of "" don't worry about it '', my credit score suddenly dropped over 200 points. I have to point out, that during the last 10 years my credit score never dropped below 700. I have no late payment. I always paid more than the minimum monthly payment. I paid off my personal loan faster than it was scheduled. Now my score is XXXX. 
5 ) malicious behavior - after filing complaint with XXXX XXXX XXXX and rejecting the Bank 's first reply with detailed reasoning as to why I rejected it and submitting documentation that proved that their reply to my complaint was factually incorrect, 5/3 bank decreased my credit limit from {$2000.00} to {$1900.00} - just to make sure I would not be able to hire a lawyer. ( attachment D ) Details : XXXX XXXX, XXXX - My husband opened a Credit card account at 5/3 bank. He was the primary account holder, I was authorised user as spouse. Account # XXXX. This account was closed in XXXX or XXXX. 
XXXX XXXX, XXXX - my husband and I met Ms. XXXX XXXX at 5/3 bank in XXXX Ohio to separate our accounts, because we were getting divorced. 2 accounts were transferred to me as the primary owner. I was supposed to be removed from the rest of accounts as user. 
XXXX - my ex-husband started to use credit card account # XXXX. I found out when I logged in to the online banking. I could see the account. I went to 5/3 bank and told them about this issue. The employee looked into the computer and told me "" don't worry about it, I can see that this account is used by your ex-husband only ''. 
- XX/XX/XXXX - I changed address upon which 5/3 bank mailed me the document that listed all "" account affected '' ( attachment A ) As you can see, neither account # XXXX, nor account # XXXX is listed. 
- XX/XX/XXXX- I received email from 5/3 bank that reminded me to "" pay attention to account # XXXX '' The email was intended to XXXX. My ex-husband 's email. 
I went to 5/3 bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, Ohio, where a gentleman called XXXX XXXX looked into the computer and got confused. He said he did not understand what was going on. I asked him to print out that page he was looking at. He did. And I am very grateful for that. ( attachment C ). 
As you can see, 5/3 bank closed account # XXXX. Reopened the old account # XXXX as replacement without updating the data. The 5/3 Bank credit card Agreement stipulates, that the account holder "" may request card for authorized users ''. - my ex-husband did NOT request a card for me as authorized user. The Bank did not send me a card for this account. On the day of reopening this account as replacement for # XXXX, I was not his spouse. As he had remarried, his spouse on that day : XX/XX/XXXX was XXXX XXXX. Not me. Totally different person. 
Yet, this Mr. XXXX XXXX called me a week after our meeting and informed me that the account is mine (!! ) and that I am responsible for the balance. 
ANOTHER TWIST : This account ( # XXXX ) was closed by the Bank on XX/XX/XXXX. 
I accused my ex-husband of committing bank fraud. 
He went to the Bank, where he was told that he had no active account and no outstanding balance. He can give a sworn statement about this. 
XXXX XXXX I received from 5/3 another reminder about account # XXXX. I decided to go to 5/3 bank in XXXX, Ohio, because that is the place where everything started. XXXX XXXX was not in, I was talking to a certain Ms. XXXX, who after checking her computer told me the following : '' ignore the reminders, we know it is your ex-husband who was using this account. '' To stop me from being harassed by these reminders, she turned off all my notifications. 
- XX/XX/XXXX- my credit score dropped over 200 points because I "" failed to make the minimum payment on my (!! ) account ''. 
This was the point when I threatened my ex-husband with legal action against him. Yet, after discussing the whole matter, we found out that the only guilty party in this whole saga is the 5/3 bank. 
I wrote a complaint to the manager of 5/3 bank in XXXX, Ohio. He replied with asking me to give him a call. I replied, that whatever it was he intended to say, I wanted it in writing, because spoken words can be denied. Never heard from him since. 
- XX/XX/XXXX - I filed a complaint against 5/3 bank at XXXX XXXX XXXX. 5/3 replied. As their reply was full of factually incorrect statements, I rejected their reply and gave detailed reasoning and attached supporting documentation. 
5/3 bank failed to reply to my rejection letter. Instead of replying, the Bank decreased my credit limit from {$20000.00} to {$1900.00}. 
Had the bank replied, they would have to admit their error. 
But denying responsibility for their mistakes is the company policy at 5/3 bank. A company policy, that - after years - results in class actions. 
Bottom line : 5/3 bank never once reminded the account owner that his account needed attention. When he went to the Bank, he was told he had no active account, no outstanding balance. 
5/3 bank ruined my credit score and left me with credit limit of {$1900.00}, because I did not make a payment on the account that was not mine, where my name should not be at all, to which I never received a card and by the way, which was closed by the Bank on XX/XX/XXXX.",,FIFTH THIRD FINANCIAL CORPORATION,OH,45440,,Consent provided,Web,2021-09-28,Closed with explanation,Yes,

At no time have I ever had an account with XXXX XXXX, nor have I ever authorized anyone to open such an account. I humbly request that all references to this account, and the negative marks related to its delinquent status, be dissociated from any record of my credit history. 

I began checking my credit regularly several years ago after the report of a substantial data breach within the South Carolina Revenue Service. Using the XXXX XXXX app I noticed an account with XXXX XXXX was under my name. After beginning my investigation in earnest, my then wife and now ex-wife informed me she opened this unauthorized account. At no point did I ever receive a XXXX XXXX, a statement was never forwarded to me, nor did I ever make a single purchase using that account. 

I have contacted XXXX XXXX dozens of times informing them that this account was created without my consent. Protests have been filed and appeals have been submitted. The only XXXX XXXX associated with this account that I have ever seen is in the name of my ex-wife. I have never be in possession of a XXXX XXXX with my name on it, nor have I ever made a single purchase of any kind with such a card.

I was unaware of this until I noticed that my credit score had dropped dramatically and I found it on my credit report. I contacted Lending Club and spoke with XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX to question how I ended up on the loan. He told me that my spouse had listed me as a XXXX. The money was deposited into his individual account so I was unaware that the loan was taken out. I believe that I should not be held responsible for the loan since I was not given the opportunity to review the terms of the agreement, or the Truth in Lending Disclosure.

Lending Club made no attempt to send me these documents by email, through regular mail, or reach me by phone to verify my status as XXXX. If an electronic signature is used to obtain consent and finalize the loan, then the signatures on the required documents should be sent from the email from the person who is entering into the contract.

Lending Club did not make any reasonable attempt to verify that I wanted to be a XXXX and in fact did not even have my email until I called to ask to have my name removed from the loan on XX/XX/XXXX.

What did Lending Club do to verify the application? I believe that even though I am the spouse I still have the legal right to review my responsibilities as XXXX-XXXX. Lending Club operates under the impression that it is acceptable to assume that the XXXX is in agreement with the terms of the loan, even though his or her electronic signature arrives through the XXXX 's email. It is certainly not the norm for spouses to share an email.so this serves as evidence that Lending Club 's practices are very weak and risky. I am asking that my name be removed from this loan.

Loan number : XXXX We were going through a nasty divorce in XXXX and he stopped paying in this loan after per USAA he had been paying on it for the previous 4 years. Since I was listed as the co borrower, USAA started contacting me. I questioned USAa because I had no knowledge of this loan, nor did I ever see this amount of money. At the time I had spoken to a female rep in XX/XX/XXXX named XXXX who stated that they send emails out to co borrowers letting them know that theyve been listed as co borrowers but before the loan is processed, the co borrower has to acknowledge the email in which per XXXX I never did. She also advised that the funds were directly deposited into mandells personal checking account and the funds were spent. She advised that I submit a claim to the USAa XXXX Fraud Investigations department but I must provide a picture Id, police report number, Fraud information and information regarding the identity of the person who obtained this info. 

I sent the information overnight and received a comfirmatuon that info was received. However, I never received anything from usaa. No phone, call, email, letter in the mail. 

I followed up a week later and was told by another Rep in Executive resolutions, that I would have to get something by a judge stating that it is not mine because, he can see where info was received but no response from the investigation team, which indicated that they find no fraud. I stated that I had to pay it because of my secret clearance but in no way was I stating that I received the funds and I wanted it on the record that I was only paying so it wouldnt hinder my job since I have XXXX children to provide for. The executive resolutions team rep stated that once I get something from a judge stating that it isnt mine. I would get all of the money back that Ive paid. 

Again, no response. I called every day for two months with no notes or anything just a guarantee that I would be called. 

I contacted the FTC in XX/XX/XXXX as well and submitted the identity theft complaint. This was also sent to usaa but still not response. 

Usaa sent me late notices but the notices were being sent to my moms address in Virginia ... keep in mind Im a member of USAA and have policies, so Im not sure where that address was obtained and why nothing was sent to my actual address. 

I contacted the credit bureaus who removed the info from my credit report but usaa continued to send me late notices. 

A circuit judge heard the details of this loan in XXXX and deemed the account in question as not mine and that my ex husband obtained it without my consent and or knowledge and it is his sole responsibility. 

I sent a second letter to USAA along with the notice to furnishes of information letter. Along with a second letter that was created by FTC. However, I finally received a letter from usaa denying my request. 

I followed up and called them again in XX/XX/XXXX and spoke with XXXX in Executive resolutions who stated that she couldnt provide me any information but noticed that no one had ever contacted me. She then sent a request for the fraud unit Manager, XXXX XXXX to call me back.

WE HAD A JOINT ACCOUNT, AND AS SOON AS THE MONEY HIT SHE MOVED IT ( increments of {$6600.00} & {$2000.00}. 
-TO ADD, SHE WAS BEING UNFAITHFUL : She was talking to 3 other guys, and who she is with now, and has been for almost 2 years, has not shaken my hand, spoke to me, or anything.

-I had to buy a bee phone as well.

With that said, I continued to make my payments through my online account, which I set up to avoid lack of payments. In the Fall of XX/XX/XXXX, Bank of America blocked my payments from the site.

Failure to do so will create even more severe and detrimental problems for me. I am asking for full reimbursement of {$5000.00} forfeited due to Chases negligence. 

I had issued a blank check ( check # XXXX ) to my soon to be ex-wife, XXXX XXXX. For personal reasons that I rather not discuss at this point, I decided to place a stop payment on this check. 

On XX/XX/2019 I requested a stop payment on check # XXXX. I requested the stop payment in person at the branch located on XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX, FL, XXXX, I spoke to Officer Relationship Banker MrXXXX XXXX XXXX, who was very helpful and even suggested placing the stop payment on the entire check book. Unfortunately, Mr. XXXX did not process the stop payment correctly. Ms. XXXX somehow learned that I had deposited {$5000.00} in the checking account, and proceeded to write the {$5000.00} on the blank check that I had given her and presented the check for payment. The check was paid to her in contravention of my instructions to the bank pursuant to the stop payment I had requested and paid for. On XX/XX/2019 Mr. XXXX acknowledged the error and processed a Branch Compliant Escalation Form ( attached ) and escalated the matter to a regional escalation department. 

On XX/XX/2019, a representative from the regional escalation department, by the name of "" XXXX '', ( Senior Client Plan Representative ), contacted me and told me that while I had requested and paid for the stop payment, there was nothing JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. can do to make me whole for the  {$5000.00}. She indicated that this was a litigation matter between me and my wife. Additionally, this representative promised that a manager would again contact me to follow up on this matter within 48 hours. I have yet not been contacted by anyone from this department again. 

I am extremely disappointed that regarding JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, has acted in such a negligent way and now is simply  dismissing this matter as a legal issue between my wife and I, which is a contradiction with report in the Branch Escalation Form, where the bank employee clearly acknowledged and accepted responsibility for the error. 

I have been a client of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A for over 10 years and have trusted them with my personal finances. This error may be insignificant for JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A, which is probably one of the largest banks in the U.S., but it is a true catastrophe for me. 

JP Morgan Chase Bank, NA acted in bad faith. Not only did they not apply the stop payment as I requested and paid for, but also they failed to inform of situations in which a stop payment would not be honored, and now they are simply dismissing the matter as if they had not caused the problem. In my humble opinion as a consumer trusting a large corporation, the way this bank handled this situation is a clear example of unfair and deceptive practices. 

I am very concerned with the issue. It is of upmost importance that I get the funds reimbursed as soon as possible. I need these funds to pay my attorney who is defending me in litigation. Not paying these funds will not allow me to formally engage his services. I am currently experiencing a very serious personal and financial crisis. This could result in severe legal and financial consequences to me. I am currently unemployed and I do not have access to any other funds to pay my attorney. Therefore, it is extremely urgent for me to get reimbursed as soon as possible.

3243149,2019-05-15,Mortgage,FHA mortgage,Applying for a mortgage or refinancing an existing mortgage,,"My name is XXXX XXXX I was the Plaintiff in the divorce proceedings that led to the controversial property disputes, I have been a member of the Credit Union since XXXX, about 11 years ago while I was in the United States XXXX XXXX   XXXX  in XXXX XXXX XXXX. I got married in XXXX and I took my wife to join Navy Federal Credit Union through my access number and she became a member. We got a conventional loan in my ex-wife 's name for XXXX at about 5.5 % and both TITLE AND DEED in both of pour names as joint owners of the property. Shortly after that by XX/XX/XXXX we got a divorce and the court initially ordered that we sell the marital home and divide the proceeds into two then subsequently we entered into an agreement in a consent order that I should remain in the house and refinance the house by taking my ex-wife names out of the loan with a buy out option with Navy Federal. 

By XX/XX/XXXX, I advised the Defendant that per the court 's order, The house needs to be put in the market for sale and that she needs to move out of the property so that we can sell it immediately. The Defendant refused and threatened if I come to the property she would call the police. I made my way to the property and started getting it ready for sale. In the process, about four policemen came to me and asked what I was doing at the house and I responded that the property belonged to me and they asked if I have any proof then I presented the deed and title of ownership. The police apologized to me that they had received a false alarm from the Defendant of breaking and entry. The police advised her that a homeowner can not break into his own home by law and there is no law against stealing or destroying what belongs to you. 

Just as I was getting the home ready for sale, in XX/XX/XXXX, the frigid weather caused the pipes in the house to burst and the house became flooded. It took me several months to put the house together with the help of XXXX XXXX insurance company. At that time the Defendant did not bother to seek a trustee sale of the property as she was not living in there and never participated in the months of repairs, I did on the house. I spent months repairing the house alone all by myself with no helps from no one including the defendant. Later in XXXX, we put the house back on the market for sale after I have fixed it, then again in early XX/XX/XXXX the house got damaged again with an ICE RAIN clogged on the roof and penetrated the dry walls then I had to do the same thing again to fix the house alone with the help of the insurance company. 

In XX/XX/XXXX, while I was living in the house and repairing the house from the damaged by flooding, I was getting ready for work as a XXXX XXXX XXXX for the XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX in the early hours of XX/XX/XXXX I got hit by a drunk driver ( photo of the accident attached ) and I officially became a XXXX Veteran of the United States XXXX while still struggling to sell my house in order to move on from the heavily contested divorce with XXXX minor children. The subsequent order that gave Plaintiff the right to refinance the home and buy out the Defendant became the only feasible alternative considering Plaintiff 's XXXX STATUS and ONLY ONE WHO KEPT THE HOME AND REPAIRED WHEN DAMAGED since it would be harder for him to get a new loan but better keep what he already owned by simple FHA refinance with a buy out of the Defendant which solved the whole disputes and problems. 

I applied for FHA loan in XXXX and XXXX XXXX, Navy Federal Credit Union Staff with NMLS # XXXX was applied as Mortgage Processor and my application was denied stating that I did not have/meet the required minimum credit score of XXXX. In XX/XX/XXXX again I applied for the same FHA refinance loan with a buy out option, Navy Federal Credit Union denied the refinance again despite a new credit score of above 650 because I had paid credit repair services and have help removed derogatory accounts and paid off balances to make my credit score qualify for FHA refinance. Because Navy Federal had taken advantage of the dispute between the parties and in favor of the earlier court order that says the house should be sold instead of the second order that says the Plaintiff should refinance and removed the Defendant 's name from the loan with a buy out option. 

Navy Federal Denied Plaintiff 's FHA loan and opted for trustee sales of the house which led to the Plaintiff being a forced out of the house with all his personal belongings out on the streets and driveway and were all stolen by the neighbors. Navy Federal 's egregious and greedy conduct because of their financial gains rendered XXXX XXXX  VET Plaintiff homeless with his XXXX children as we speak with all his personal belongings stolen and destroyed. Navy Federal has a copy of the court orders first and second and copies of the deed of recording and title of ownership. Navy Federal Credit Union was aware of Plaintiff 's fixing the house exclusively without any bits of help or cooperation from the Defendant. Navy Federal was aware of Plaintiff making mortgage payments on the loans despite his name not on the loan. Yet this ruthless credit union wilfully and maliciously sold his home and rendered him homeless while disable. 

The controversial consent order is currently being clarified by the circuit court in XXXX  XXXX and it clarifications will show that Navy Federal acted with malice and in complete disregards of Plaintiff 's  constitutional rights including the right to ownership of the property and to be safe in his home with his properties. The clarification will also show that the trustee committed fraud, an extrinsic fraud that legally guarantees the CANCELATION of the sales and voids the ratifications of the contract, a type of fraud that is above common irregularities or mistakes. In any event, Plaintiff maintains the trustee 's conduct and Navy Federal 's conduct led to Plaintiff becoming homeless as he has no way of controlling what happened to him or the reasons why he became XXXX while his properties sold without him being given not even a single penny from the proceeds and his personal belongings were vandalized and stolen completely. The order was acted upon to the contrast and also was misinterpreted completely to suit their own financial profits and rendered an innocent man homeless with his children.",Company believes it acted appropriately as authorized by contract or law,NAVY FEDERAL CREDIT UNION,MD,20854,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2019-05-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,

I've sent a written request for this same validation yet they have continuously refused to provide it, in violation of 15 USC 1692g 809.

Yesterday I received a dispute response from XXXX which really has me baffled and concerned about my credit report and how to keep it fit for the economy and country that I live in, the United States of America. 
In XX/XX/XXXX, XXXX added a delinquent mortgage account to my credit report. An account for a home that my ex-spouse resides. In the last two months the other two reporting agencies have added the default mortgage as well. My ex asked for the home in our divorce ( XX/XX/XXXX ) and was granted the home in writing by the judge of our divorce proceeding. He did not have my name removed or made any other attempts to show that he no longer wanted me to have a part of the home. He faulted on the VA loan and hasn't made any payments on the loan in almost four years. 

XX/XX/XXXX, he filed bankruptcy, which means he isn't responsible for payments, and can not be solicited for the payments, but I am. He lives in the home with his family, not me. I spoke to the newest mortgage company, XXXX XXXX   XXXX, and asked them to foreclose the home or put it on the market for sale if I am the new responsible party because they will not adhere to the decree. The did not, and they also denied his paperwork for a modification for the loan and so did XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, the original owners. The first choice for them is to wait on me to make a payment and for him to live in the home for free. I will not pay a mortgage for a home that I do not reside. XXXX attempted to insert me into his loan modification in XX/XX/XXXX but he told me not to worry about it. I learned that I was to sign a quick deed, which did not alleviate me of financial responsibility anyway. All in all, it would've gotten payments made if they had accepted his paperwork. I am not sure the specifics to that issue. 

Then I am told that the rules for foreclosure have to be met per the state 's requirements. Well how many rules and laws does it take to understand that the house is not free and the mortgage is due? Virginia needs to get it together. These mortgage companies who are not listening to what is being said should also get it together. 

The home was purchased in XX/XX/XXXX and costs more now than it did when it was purchased, he is currently {$140000.00} in arrears. That's about a fourth of the cost of the home.. If you can live for free then there is no incentive to pay the mortgage! At the same time, permission is not needed to make a payment. He could have been making payments all this time with or without a modification. Its not like the mortgage company will return the checks, or will they? 

I am writing to ask that XXXX XXXX   remove this home from my credit report, all three, and give him a payment plan for the mortgage or foreclose/sale the home immediately. XXXX should also place a valid phone number on the credit reports.I would also like the credit reporting agencies to delete "" remove per divorce decree '' as an option for a dispute if the decree is not sufficient or will not be upheld once provided.",,"EQUIFAX, INC.",KY,40175,Servicemember,Consent provided,Web,2018-02-15,Closed with explanation,Yes,

For the past 4 years I have desperately tried to get SunTrust to assist me in taking my name off the loan. SunTrust told me that only my x-husband could take my name off the loan. SunTrust then refused to help me in this matter even after I filed my first complaint with the CFPB a few months ago. SunTrust told me to wait until the note was due and see if my x-husband would pay it off or not. So here I am trying again to get the bank to tell me what happened exactly with the note and they have refused to tell me specific information that I need to know in order to determine what plan of action I need to take. I have no way of receiving any mail from the bank because it goes directly to my x-husband. He refuses to share any information from the bank about our loan to me. On XXXX XXXX I called SunTrust bank and explained my situation on how I have been denied information for a loan that my name is attached to. A bank representative gave me the name of the individual that had been assigned to our case. I was then told that the note WAS NOT paid off only a payment of {$1400.00} was made on XXXX XXXX. So since that date I have called this individual 4 times and left detailed messages on why Im calling and asked him to call me. I have NEVER received a return call and it has been well over a month.

I was irate at this point and called SunTrust again for help with getting this man to call me!!!! I even began to doubt that this person even worked for SunTrust bank. The bank told me he was still employed by them and they sent him a direct emailed asking him to contact me as soon as possible. The bank told me if he didnt get back with me to call them back. This is absolutely ridiculous and unprofessional in every way. I do not know what else to do in order to get help with this matter, so Im filing this complaint in order to see if the CFPB can contact SunTrust for some answers in my case.

I filed charges against this person for impersonating me and stealing thousands of dollars through 3 credit cards of mine, Chase, XXXX XXXX XXXX, and XXXX. Two of these cards, XXXX XXXX XXXX and XXXX cleared the fraudulent debt immediately with no trouble, but Chase has continued to improperly report this debt to intentionally damaged my credit report through false reports. I have attempted to resolve this issue for more than a year on my own to no avail. The Chase card "" investigators '' of the fraud claim have fabricated information making such claims as I provided access to these cards on my own free will, allowed the ex to use them, and even that I was liable because we co-habitated making this a civil matter. I have asked them for documentation to show me where this evidence was gathered, but they refuse. I have never allowed this ex to use my cards and made it clear she took them without my permission, yet they filed reports that it was consensual and permission granted. 
I have asked for copies of their card agreement with the section highlighted showing me where this would be considered civil as a basis for this decision and they refuse ( I presume because it does not exist ), and have even asked for a copy of my agreement to where I signed this agreement binding me to these terms and contract, to which one was never been provided, either electronically or through the mail. 

At no time was the person who stole this money given permission to access or use my credit cards, thus resulting in XXXX XXXX XXXX with my local police department of identity theft and credit card fraud. I have provided these police reports to Chase who refuses to accept them. Instead, Chase insists this matter is civil as a way to avoid honoring their fraud guarantee they promote in solicitation of their cards. When asked how I am not protected on this fraud protection guarantee, they continue to state their review has resulted in the investigation being deemed civil. Chase is knowingly damaging my credit for a debt they have been provided proof is not the result of my actions. They refuse to accept these documents and are the only company I have had any issues with as a result of this fraud. I have provided disputes to the credit bureaus and XXXX XXXX deleted the entry, yet XXXX and XXXX   continue to report this charged off card as valid because they state Chase has provided them responses that the debt is valid. In just XX/XX/XXXX Chase falsely reported to XXXX that the police report provided to them as proof of the fraud was in of itself a material misrepresentation! 

Chase will stop at nothing to cause me damage on my credit in an attempt to force me to settle on this debt which is entirely a fraudulent account. I have no other late payments or derogatory marks on my credit history other than Chase. I have threatened Chase with legal action, to which the representative literally laughed stating I was bound by their arbitration agreement and they would choose the arbitrator and I would have to pay, so "" good luck ''. I understand this clause is an attempt to save time in the court system, but it is also to make it impossible to provide a fair trial in front of a judge. I then suggested Chase should simply sue me in court if they felt it was a justified debt, because I would never repay this debt and would be happy to explain this in front of a judge who would dismiss their case. Naturally, Chase refuses to accept this offer because they know they can not win as my evidence and officers who took the fraud report and investigators working the case can testify to the legitimacy of the fraud. 

The attempt by Chase to prevent me from having this account deleted is purely for intentional damage to my financial health as well as to harass me to try to get me to break and settle this debt. Since I have attempted all other solutions, I am reaching out to your office for assistance in this matter. Chase is quite literally keeping me hanging in limbo and chooses not to take any actions of collection or court proceedings knowing they will lose, but also refuses to accept the documentation that this account was the result of Fraud.

He too agreed that XXXX payment was made on time however he explained ( and their calls are monitored I hope ) that because I had made the payment before it got to 30 days each month that XXXX could never report it as being late because I made the payment but with final payoffs they are allowed to bring the account current ( that didnt make sense to me but whatever ). He went to Looking through the records and said something about a payment in XXXX being late. I said thats fine but can you please update my credit report. Because although my husband hasnt shown up to any court dates he could potentially show up at one and use the credit report as proof that I claim to be so worried about my credit yet the ONE MONTH when I towed the car from him to sell it is the month that was +30 days over. I just want whatever the late month is if there is even one to be shown. He told me my credit report should be showing the correct month and if I felt it was incorrect to email him and he would look. He was very rude. I hope you can listen to the call.

My vehicle was a XXXX XXXX, and at the last minute, he decided he needed a XXXX XXXX. We weren't offered the option to purchase the vehicles, even though we were told we were qualified to purchase or lease. We were rushed through the process and at some point in the paperwork detail after signing, they changed my personal information to someone with the same name, living in the same city but everything else was correct. I complained about that because they kept calling my husband about offers and such for everything related to MY car we only received phone calls and were told that information had been mailed. The issue seemed to be resolved as they sent a letter addressed to me at my address shortly after, regarding the XXXX. 

Still, all calls came to my husband for service appointments, questions about the car and what we wanted to do when the lease was up. My husband was very XXXX with the bank account and paid all the bills. He was also very XXXX  with everything else. The police had been called to my home 3 times in a week because he became XXXX XXXX  with my XXXX. He had been reported to XXXX on at least two different occasions by more than one person. After putting a little money aside for several months, I was finally able to pack up my children and leave my husband on XX/XX/XXXX. 

In preparation for this move, I downloaded the GM Financial App on my phone changed the password for my vehicle, changed the payment method ( as it was all his information ) and I made a {$500.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX. That was the amount that the GM Financial app said was due when I made the payment. I paid my rent and ( partial and XXXX month ) XX/XX/XXXX and planned to pay XXXX with my check on XX/XX/XXXX, which was when payment was due. In the background, my husband opened up a new bank account and when the cell phone bill went through ( auto pay ), it had been sent back as NSF and the 3 phones ( mine and both of our children 's ) were disconnected. I figured that I would just take care of the car payment on Monday XX/XX/XXXX when I went to work. It would just be 3 days late, and I wasn't really sweating that too much. 
I spent Saturday on the home phone fighting to get the cell phone turned back on. Sunday, I went grocery shopping and to the XXXX, went home and got ready for work the next day. On Monday, XX/XX/XXXX, I walked out the door at XXXX XXXX  to go to work and my car was gone. I looked around and there wasn't any broken glass, no sign of theft ... I went back in the apartment and called XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, my now estranged husband. I was so panicked that I couldn't think straight. That's when he told me that they had been calling him about a payment and he told them to "" just come get the XXXX XXXX   '' he said he was on his way to my apartment. I began calling GM Financial. I was transferred to the vehicle recovery ( or whatever it's called ) line. My calls started at XXXX ET. They wouldn't be open for 2 more hours. The gentleman that transferred me told me that I had to leave a message and they would call me back as soon as they were able. I left my name and MY phone number. I called my new boss ( because I had just been promoted ) to tell her that I had a problem with my car and I wouldn't be able to make it in. I had {$1200.00} to my name and I was praying that was enough to get my car back. 

Two hours passed and there wasn't a phone call. I called back, left my number again. My husband showed up at my apartment and left, telling me to call him when I found out what I needed to do to get the car back. I called back several times with no return call. Later that afternoon, I called and finally got a hold of an agent named XXXX XXXX XXXX. She wasn't in the financial recovery department ... she just answered the regular number ... but she was willing to help me. She advised that to get my car back, it would cost {$3000.00}. She gave me the steps necessary to obtain my car and I questioned the amount. She said that the only payment made between XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX ( the one I made ) was a partial payment at the beginning of XXXX. I talked with her for a long while and told her about the situation and I asked for a breakdown of payments since the beginning of the lease and she said she would have to mail it. I never received it. She also advised that the XXXX was current on payments. 

Later, XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX came to get me with promises of getting my car back but we would have to stay with him and "" share '' the XXXX until we could figure it out. Sharing meant him taking me where I needed to go when it was okay or convenient. 

Back in the house I hated and had to escape from, held XXXX with no means of transportation to get back and forth to work. Later he told me that all the messages that I left for GM Financial to call MY number, they had called HIS number. Of course, he never answered and as always, let the calls just go to voice mail. I have since learned that there have been several voice mails left for him. 

After two days, I had a day off from work and after listening to how we wouldn't get my car back anytime soon ( with fees and payments piling up ) we would never be able to get it back and if I was XXXX enough to believe he would come up with all this money eventually, one or all of us would have been hurt, or worse, XXXX. 

I took my XXXX and went to a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX lot and got a car, just so we could get out and go back to safety. 

A letter was sent from GM Financial to my estranged husband on XX/XX/XXXX, two days after my conversation with agent XXXX XXXX XXXX  and it said that we had ten days to come up with {$21000.00} ( the  value of the car ) or it would be sold at auction. I also had 10 days to claim my personal belongings that were in the car or they would be discarded. I received that letter on XX/XX/XXXX, two days too late even though I had spoken with XXXX XXXX XXXX on the XXXX and advised that I planned to get the car back. I immediately called again and was sent to that good old voicemail. Once again, I left a message with MY number. I never got a return call, he did. 

One last ditch attempt I got through to GM Financial and was transferred to an agent in the Spanish speaking department. She couldn't help me but was able to verify that my number was listed on the account. 

Just yesterday I received a call ( left a voicemail ) from XXXX XXXX XXXX 's manager asking me to call and let them help me get in the vehicle of my choice? They have my phone number?? They want to talk to ME??? 

We are not living in the XXXX 's where a wife has to get "" permission '' to own a car and the man is the decision maker and the only one with a voice. A female can walk onto a car lot and purchase a vehicle, can have a bank account and make her own money. Someone obviously forgot to tell GM Financial. 

After that long story, here is my list of complaints : 1 ) There was NEVER ANY communication with ME that MY car payments were behind at all, when two parties enter into an agreement, both parties should be contacted. Not one phone call, not one letter, not one email, not one anything. 

2 ) When told to "" just come get the XXXX XXXX XXXX  there was never a call made to the co-borrower ( whom is driving said vehicle ) to ensure both parties agreed to that. 

3 ) I have left at least seven messages, all with MY phone number and I have YET to receive a phone call. HE has received every call back. WHY? 

4 ) I have a list of conformation numbers where payments were made but I have nothing to research and verify because I can't get them to mail me anything. 

5 ) My credit is damaged because a repossession has been reported to all 3 credit reporting companies. 

6 ) My car had XXXX miles when I pulled off the lot. It only had XXXX when it was repossessed.",,"General Motors Financial Company, Inc.",KY,40206,,Consent provided,Web,2018-08-11,Closed with explanation,Yes,
